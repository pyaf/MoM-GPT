<v Rishabh Agrahari>Hi everyone.</v>

00:00:03.830 --> 00:00:09.660
<v Rishabh Agrahari>Today I'm going to demonstrate how we can use chat GPT.</v>

00:00:11.210 --> 00:00:12.500
<v Rishabh Agrahari>To summarize our meetings.</v>

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:14.000
<v Rishabh Agrahari>Create meeting minutes.</v>

00:00:18.130 --> 00:00:23.180
<v Rishabh Agrahari>So this app that I've built is using stream lit.</v>

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:31.480
<v Rishabh Agrahari>And Open AI API library.</v>

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:36.340
<v Rishabh Agrahari>It currently.</v>

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:40.420
<v Rishabh Agrahari>Uses the transcription files.</v>

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:44.970
<v Rishabh Agrahari>To extract the meeting discussion points.</v>

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:51.160
<v Rishabh Agrahari>And then uses Open AI API to summarize.</v>

00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:55.360
<v Rishabh Agrahari>It can summarize very long meetings.</v>

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:02.270
<v Rishabh Agrahari>And can also extract action items.</v>

00:01:04.980 --> 00:01:07.130
<v Rishabh Agrahari>This app uses chat GPT in the back end.</v>

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:12.700
<v Rishabh Agrahari>And the model is text Davinci.</v>

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:18.830
<v Rishabh Agrahari>Looks pretty cool.</v>

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:21.730
<v Rishabh Agrahari>Yeah. Let me show how it works.</v>

00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:27.840
<v Rishabh Agrahari>It will be on me to show how it works. I'll give a demo.</v>

00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:33.190
<v Rishabh Agrahari>As soon as I'm done working on all the features of this application.</v>

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:39.240
<v Rishabh Agrahari>I think it should be done within a week.</v>

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:44.290
<v Rishabh Agrahari>By next weekend, I mean.</v>
